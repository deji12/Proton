>>> Hi there, i am sure you are here because you need help understanding proton. Lets get right into it:

$$: Note: most or all commands have their abbrevations. You can decide to input the abbrevation or the full command. $$

>> When proton is opened, after inputing your name, you would see something like:
			>>> Input s or start to start
			>>> Input h or help for help	
			>>> Input com or commands to see commands 

	> s - 'input s or start' (which ever one you choose to input) is the start command for proton. 

	
	> h - 'input h or help' (which ever one you choose to input) is the help command for users who need help understanding how to use proton.
	    Yuou are here because you inputed either h or help


	> com - 'input com or command' (which ever one you choose to input) shows you the list of all commands that can be run on proton.
	       Note: any inputed command or value that is not within this list will not run and will print an error message. 



>>> 'Start' or 's' (which ever one you choose to input)
	
	> When start or s is inputed, you would see:
		
		> How may i help you today 'your name': 
							
			> Now there are some commands you can run from here. These commands are:

				> Commands:

					-- calc
					-- sc or see constants 
					-- uc or unit conversion 
					(Enter com or commands to see all commands at the (Input s, h, or com:) request)


>>> calc - calc commands
	> The calc command is to tell proton that you want it to make some calculations for you. But under this calc command, there are 
	other commands that work with it. Some of them are:
		
		> Commands:

			-- whc or what can you calculate - this is a request you are sending to proton to ask what operations it can perform
			-- nothing - here, you are telling proton you dont want to calculate anything
			-- fre or frequency
			-- wl or wavelength
			-- eoppf or energy of a photon when planks constant and frequency are given 
			-- eoppsw or energy of a photon when planks constant, speed of light, and wavelength are given
			-- wf or work function
		
		(check commands to see the rest of the commands)


>>> patterns to follow:
	> starting proton:
		> Input s, h, or com > s 
	or	> Input s, h, or com > start
	

	> seeking help:
		> Input s, h, or com > h
	or	> Input s, h, or com > help

	
	> check commands:
		> Input s, h, or com > com
	or	> Input s, h, or com > command

	
	> make calculations:
		> Input s, h, or com > s > calc (check commands or com for possible calculations)

	
	> see constants:
		> Input s, h, or com > s > sc
	or	> Input s, h, or com > s > see constants


	> units conversions:
		> Input s, h, or com > s > uc
	or	> Input s, h, or com > s > unit conversion
