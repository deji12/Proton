>>> I can calculate:

> Under photoelectricity:
	> frequency: f = c/?
	
	> wavelength: ? = c/f
	
	> energy of a photon when:
		
		> plank constant and frequency are present: E = hf
		
		> plank constant, speed of light, and wavelength are present: E = hc/?
		
		> work function and kinetic energy are present: E = W + K.E (Einstein's equation)

		> plank constant, frequency, threshold frequency, mass, velocity: hf = hfo + 1/2mv^2 (Einstein's equation)

	> convert energy E into electronvolts(eV)

> Under Maths:
	> quadratic equations using almighty formula

	> percentages

	> simple arithmetic operations (+, -, /, *)
