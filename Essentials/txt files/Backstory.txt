YEAR 5106
EARTH'S STATUS: UNHIHABITABLE AND VOID OF LIFE
DAYS SPENT IN SPACE: OVER 3000 YEARS

	GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS HAVE PASSED, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN, BUT THIS SINGULAR
	MEMORY BURNS IN THE HEAD OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE JUDGEMENT DAY.
	

BACKSTORY:

	IT WAS THE YEAR 2021, THE MONTH OF MARCH TO BE EXACT. AN AVERAGE DAY FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON 
	IF YOU ASK ME. NEWS BROKE OUT THAT AN ASTEROID TWICE THE SIZE OF OUR MOON WAS GOING TO PASS 
	BY EARTH.
